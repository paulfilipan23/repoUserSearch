# What is this project about?

This project is gonna search for a github repository or user.

# How to start the project

Pull the project.
Create a .env file at the root of the project and set `GITHUB_TOKEN` with you own API KEY.

And then run

### `npm run start-all`

This is gonna start both the front-end app, but also a small API that's gonna act like a middleware.

Thanks
